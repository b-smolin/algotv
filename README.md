# Algo TV

A web app that animates each step of various algorithms so one might admire their beauty. My first time developing an app using Flask and one of my first React projects as well.

## Current Status
Bubblesort is supported without animated transitions between each step. Pressing the "Show me Bubblesort!" button multiple times before a sort has executed will cause the program to behave erratically.

## Running the Program
- run `flask --app server run` in ~/algotv/backend
- run `npm start` in ~/algotv/frontend

You should be able to visit the site on http://localhost:3000 once both programs are running.
